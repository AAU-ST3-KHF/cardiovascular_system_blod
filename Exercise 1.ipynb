    "### Peclet's Number\n",
    "The Péclet number (Pe) is a dimensionless quantity representing the ratio of transport by convection (advection) to transport by diffusion, and for oxygen transfer from blood to a cell, it can be generally expressed as \n",
    "$$Pe = \\frac{v * L}{D}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, '$v$' is the characteristic fluid velocity (e.g., red blood cell velocity or plasma flow velocity), '$L$' is a characteristic length scale (such as the capillary radius or cell size), and '$D$' is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the surrounding medium (e.g., plasma or tissue). \n",
    "A high $Pe$ value, where convection dominates, means oxygen is quickly transported by the flow, while a low value indicates diffusion is the primary transport mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation for Oxygen Transfer\n",
    "- **Pe > 1 (Convection-Dominated):**\n",
    "    When the Peclet number is significantly greater than 1, it signifies that the rate at which oxygen is transported by the fluid's bulk flow (convection) is much faster than its transport due to concentration gradients (diffusion). In this regime, the movement of oxygen is primarily dictated by the fluid's movement. \n",
    "- **Pe < 1 (Diffusion-Dominated):** \n",
    "    If the Peclet number is less than 1, diffusion becomes the dominant process for oxygen transport. The movement of oxygen is driven by its tendency to spread from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. \n",
    "- **Pe ≈ 1 (Mixed Regimes):**\n",
    "    In situations where the Peclet number is around 1, both convection and diffusion are important and contribute to the overall transport of oxygen. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Application\n",
    "\n",
    "- Microchannel studies: have shown that for small channel heights and high flow rates, the Péclet number is large, indicating that advection (convection) is the primary mode of oxygen transport. \n",
    "- In the microvascular system, the flow of blood and red blood cells moves oxygen towards the tissues. The Péclet number helps determine if the rate of delivery by this flow is sufficient to meet the metabolic demand of the tissue, or if diffusion-limited transport becomes the bottleneck. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algebraic Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we are working with transfer of Oxygen, where $D=1.8e-3 mm^2/s$.\n",
    "Add a model that describes Peclet's number as a function of tissue depth for the 4 scenarios above.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make a model that calculates Peclet's number\n",
    "- Plot for each of the 4 scenarios above, peclets number on the approiate axes. "
